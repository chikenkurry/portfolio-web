            Hey there, folks! I'm Cledwyn Chan, currently in my sophomore year studying 
            Computer Science at SMU. When I'm not immersed in code or buried in books, 
            you can find me exploring the world, cheering on my favorite sports teams like 
            Real Madrid in football, Red Bull in F1, and the Warriors in the NBA. While I enjoy 
            watching sports, I also love getting active myself, whether it's on the football 
            field or hitting the gym.

            As a CS student, gaming is naturally part of my life. 
            From FPS games like CS2, Valorant and siege to diving into epic adventures in triple-A titles
            like GTA 5 and Assasins Creed, gaming is my go-to for relaxation and excitement.
            Lately, though, I've been captivated by the thrill of sim racing.
            
            Traveling holds a special
            place in my heart, especially exploring the vibrant cultures of Korea and Japan.

            Well, from a young age, my fascination with computers and gaming has been unwavering.
            Yet, the joy of multiplayer gaming often turned sour due to the presence of cheaters 
            and hackers who exploited vulnerabilities within the game. Rather than succumb to the 
            temptation to cheat, I became intrigued by the mechanisms underlying these exploits and
            the ease with which anti-cheat systems could be circumvented. This curiosity sparked a 
            deep interest in understanding the intricacies of cybersecurity and exploring potential 
            solutions to safeguard digital environments.
            Through witnessing the disruptive impact of cheating firsthand, I recognized the critical 
            importance of cybersecurity in preserving the integrity and fairness of online experiences. 
            My desire to pursue cybersecurity stems from a proactive stance against malicious activities, 
            driven by a passion to protect digital ecosystems from exploitation and ensure a safe and equitable
            online environment for all users.
